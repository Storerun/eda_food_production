Context
As the world’s population has expanded and gotten richer, the demand for food, energy and water has seen a rapid increase. Not only has demand for all three increased, but they are also strongly interlinked: food production requires water and energy; traditional energy production demands water resources; agriculture provides a potential energy source. This article focuses on the environmental impacts of food. Ensuring everyone in the world has access to a nutritious diet in a sustainable way is one of the greatest challenges we face.

Content
This dataset contains most 43 most common foods grown across the globe and 23 columns as their respective land, water usage and carbon footprints.

Columns

Land use change - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product
Animal Feed - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product
Farm - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product
Processing - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product
Transport - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product
Packaging - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product
Retail - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product
These represent greenhouse gas emissions per kg of food product(Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product) across different stages in the lifecycle of food production.

Eutrophication – the pollution of water bodies and ecosystems with excess nutrients – is a major environmental problem. The runoff of nitrogen and other nutrients from agricultural production systems is a leading contributor.
